# ITIL 4


### ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) : 
- ITIL is a flexible framework that provides a set of detailed best practices for implementing and improving ITSM. It is not a rigid standard, but rather a guide that organizations can adopt and adapt to their specific needs.



### ITSM (IT Service Management) : 
- ITSM is a broad, strategic approach that views IT as a service provider for the business. The goal of ITSM is to ensure that IT services are aligned with business needs, delivered efficiently, and provide value to end-users and customers. It includes a variety of core processes:

  - Incident Management: Restoring normal service as quickly as possible.

  - Problem Management: Identifying and fixing the root cause of incidents to prevent them from recurring.

  - Change Management: Managing changes to IT systems in a controlled way to minimize risk.

  - Service Request Management: Handling routine requests from users for new services or support.



#### ITIL 4 Focuses on:

- value: the purpose of an organization is to create value for its stakeholder's

- outcome: an outcome is a result of the service. they are specific and help you know whether you have reached your goal

- Co-creating of value: to deliver high-quality output, the service provider should maintain an interactive relationship with its stakeholders

- managing specific costs and risks: the amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource should be managed wisely


### ITIL 4 includes 34 practices, which are organized into three major categories. Here are some examples from each category:

1. General Management Practices : 

- These practices are based on principles from general business management and are adapted for a service management context. They are used to align the entire organization's capabilities and resources. 

2. Service Management Practices : 

- These are the core of ITIL and are specific to IT service management. They focus on delivering and supporting IT services. 


3. Technical Management Practices : 

 - These practices focus on the technical infrastructure and applications used to deliver services. 

- an incident is the "effect" (the service is down), and a problem is the "cause" (the underlying reason it went down).

- The 7 ITIL Guiding Principles :
1. Focus on value:
All activities should directly create value for customers and stakeholders. 
2. Start where you are:
Do not discard existing resources, processes, or tools; instead, assess what you have and use it as a foundation. 
3. Progress iteratively with feedback:
Break down large changes into smaller, manageable parts and use customer feedback to guide improvements. 
4. Collaborate and promote visibility:
Encourage communication and openness between different teams to break down silos and ensure everyone is aware of what is happening. 
5. Think and work holistically:
Recognize that all parts of the organization are interconnected and that actions in one area can impact others. 
6. Keep it simple and practical:
Avoid making processes or solutions more complex than necessary, focusing on practical and straightforward approaches. 
7. Optimize and automate:
Use technology to handle routine tasks and improve efficiency, allowing people to focus on more complex and valuable work.
